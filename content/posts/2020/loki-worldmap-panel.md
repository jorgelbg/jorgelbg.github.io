[Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) is a new~ish project from [Grafana](https://grafana.com), yes
the same company behind the popular open-source observability platform. Loki itself is a
horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus.

On fewer words, Loki is like Prometheus but for your logs. This means that although it doesn't
provide all the full-text search capabilities of Elasticsearch, it allows filtering by a set of
labels for each log stream. This translates into a more cost-effective solution.

Loki was announced on [KubeCon
18'](https://kccna18.sched.com/event/GrXC/on-the-oss-path-to-full-observability-with-grafana-david-kaltschmidt-grafana-labs).
and it is still under active development. As expected the team is building in parallel the internal Loki
components: ingestion, storage, and query layer and the visualization UI (Grafana). It was not until recently that I've started to play with Loki. My main experience is about
running large [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and/or
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/de/elasticsearch) clusters, but I was looking for something
a bit easier and cheaper to host by myself. After all, I was not interested in all
the features offered by the ELK stack.

My data consist of a few labels and perhaps an optional message. I am more interested in the labels
tho. Some of those labels contained the latitude (`lat`), longitude (`long`) and _geohash_
(`geohash`) of a given location. A [geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) is a popular
public domain geocoding system invented in 2008 by Gustavo Niemeyer which encodes a geographic
location into a short string of letters and digits. My event also included some descriptive
information like `place` (city) and `country`.

I wanted to plot this data into a map using the [Worldmap
Panel](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-worldmap-panel/installation). Yet, it was a bit of
a bumpy road. I was already running a container with the latest version of Grafana since I was using
the Explore UI from Grafana with the Loki datasource to check the incoming data. [Adding the
`grafana-worldmap-panel` plugin](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/docker/#install-plugins-in-the-docker-container) can be done by definiting the `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS` environment
variable while running the container:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e "GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=grafana-worldmap-panel" grafana/grafana
```

My initial thought was to point the Worldmap Panel to the Loki datasource and run one of the
[LogQL](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/master/docs/logql.md) queries. The query
ended up looking like:

```js
sum(count_over_time({geohash=~".+"}[1h])) by (geohash,lat,long,country,place)
```

This didn't work. Using the query inspector from Grafana I noticed that the response payload
from Loki was almost identical to the output of a Prometheus query. The next step was
to try and replicate the setup explained in [this
post](https://www.robustperception.io/using-geohashes-with-the-worldmap-panel-and-prometheus).

Trying to show the data setting the Location Data as a geohash yielded this error:

```
Error: Missing geohash value
```

Which made a bit of sense, since we need to set the `{{ geohash }}` as the legend of our query. This
makes the `geohash` label (when using a Prometheus datasource) available to the Worldmap panel. Since
the legend input is missing when using the Loki datasource it is not possible to configure it like this.
I also tried to use the Location Data (i.e `lat` and `long`) as a table, which ended up looking
like:

{{< picture "loki-table-fail" "Setup of the Loki datasource as a table" "50%" >}}

Although this setup didn't produce any errors it didn't visualize anything on the map either ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
The missing **piece of the puzzle** is that we can configure the Loki datasource _*as a*_ Prometheus
datasource in Grafana ü§Ø.

To do this we need to create a Prometheus datasource in Grafana but point it out to the Loki
endpoint:

{{< picture "loki-and-prometheus-datasources" "Both datasources configured in the Grafana instance" >}}

As you can see we use the same URL as before, but we need to add the `/loki` path to the Prometheus
datasource.

Using Loki as a Prometheus datasources allows us to use the same query as before, but have
access to the configuration options only available to a Prometheus datasource. We can now follow the
instructions in the [mentioned
post](https://www.robustperception.io/using-geohashes-with-the-worldmap-panel-and-prometheus) to
visualize the labels stored in a Loki datasource in the Worldmap panel.

The end result looks like:

{{< picture "loki-end-result" "A Worldmap panel visualzing geohash data from a Loki datasource">}}

## Summary

TL;DR you can configure a Loki datasource as a Prometheus datasource in Grafana, this will give us
access to the same bells and whistles of a normal Prometheus server. Keep in mind that
[LogQL](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/master/docs/logql.md), the query language implemented by
Loki, is a _subset_ of PromQL, which means that not all functions, aggregations or operators will be
available.

This step of configuring Loki as a Prometheus datasource is mandatory (at least for Grafana v6.6.2,
latest stable release at the time of publishing this post) to get the Worldmap Panel plugin playing
nicely with your Loki datasource(s). I imagine that in the no so far future Loki support in Grafana
will improve making things like using a 3rd party plugin easier.
