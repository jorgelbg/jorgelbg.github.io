A good alert should be actionable and investigable. For me, this means getting a answer to the following questions:
What happened? Was the traffic to the Web site unusually low? Did the number of errors increase? This is the type of information that the alert should contain in a clear and visible way.
Why an alert triggered?</description></item><item><title>Optimize Grafana dashboards with Elasticsearch index aliases</title><link>//jorgelbg.me/2018/12/optimize-grafana-dashboards-with-elasticsearch-index-aliases/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>//jorgelbg.me/2018/12/optimize-grafana-dashboards-with-elasticsearch-index-aliases/</guid><description>Grafana is a very popular opensource dashboarding solution. Provides support for a long list of storage solutions, including Elasticsearch. Unfortunately, the ES support is not at the same level as the one you get for InfluxDB, for instance. Still, Grafana allows combining in the same dashboard different data sources. It is possible to have a panel fetching data from ES and a different panel fetching data from InfluxDB.
Grafana ❤️ Elasticsearch Grafana provides stellar support for InfluxDB &amp;amp; Prometheus, among others.</description></item></channel></rss>
