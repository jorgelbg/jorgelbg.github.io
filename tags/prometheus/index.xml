We ended up using this exporter that provided exactly the metrics that we needed. After adding metadata caching to reduce the load on our Kafka cluster we deployed the exporter to our Nomad cluster and started to build dashboards.
While I was making changes to the application. I needed not only to check the logs but also to graph the data that the exporter was getting from Kafka, to make sure that my changes were not breaking the normal behavior.</description></item><item><title>Logs and metrics for Small Data</title><link>//jorgelbg.me/2018/08/logs-and-metrics-for-small-data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Aug 2018 05:42:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>//jorgelbg.me/2018/08/logs-and-metrics-for-small-data/</guid><description>This post is a personal comment. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how using some tools thought for &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo;â„¢ makes sense for common development tasks. If you hear someone talking about ELK, Grafana or Prometheus, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think about a system to run your laptop during development, right?
Logs Concatenating files, parsing logs, are some of those tasks that are part of our daily routine as developers. We type lots of commands (usually connected via pipes |) to accomplish a given goal.</description></item></channel></rss>
